### TEST: Verify work_dir functionality ###

wham_settings:
  data_dir: "../states/data"
  metadata_dir: "../states/metadata"

wham_steps:
  - name: "workdir_set_to_script_dir"
    command: ["../../test/scripts/bash/workdir.sh"]
    # work_dir is set to the script's directory, relative to this config file.
    work_dir: "../scripts/bash"

  - name: "workdir_not_set"
    command: ["../../test/scripts/bash/workdir.sh"]
    # work_dir is omitted, so it should run in the WHAM process's CWD.
